# Solana Wallet Connector

A simple React application that connects to a Solana wallet (Phantom), retrieves wallet balance, and sends SOL (Solana tokens) between addresses. This project showcases the use of FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) and SIMPLE architectures for organizing the codebase.

## Features

- Connect to Phantom wallet
- Fetch wallet balance
- Send SOL to another address

## Architectures

This project includes two architectural patterns:

- **FSD (Feature-Sliced Design)**: A modular architecture that promotes high cohesion and low coupling by organizing code into features and layers.
- **SIMPLE**: A straightforward architecture that focuses on simplicity and ease of understanding, suitable for smaller projects or prototypes.

## Technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- Solana Web3.js
- Phantom Wallet

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired architecture folder (either `FSD` or `SIMPLE`).
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173/ to access the application.

### Instructions for Use:
- You can copy the above markdown text directly into your README.md file.
- Ensure that your folder structure clearly separates the FSD and SIMPLE architectures so that users can easily navigate to the appropriate folder when following the instructions.
